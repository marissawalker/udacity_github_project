### Python Bikeshare Project
This project was for Udacity's python for data science course.

### Description
The bike share project analyzes data about a bike share service in several cities. It gives information such as the most popular start and end stations for users and average trip durations. 

### Files used
The python script bikeshare.py uses csv data files of city bikeshare data (data from Motivate - https://motivateco.com/ downloaded from udacity.com). The data is not stored in this repository, so it must be downloaded separately for the script to work properly.
